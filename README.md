# Data Coding API Client

This is sample code for connecting, authenticating and making requests to the CACI Data Coding API.

You need to install the necessary libraries first by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can then make a call to the API with your authentication client key and secret, and by executing:
```bash
python call_caci_api.py
```
